Remember that time you published your app, and it was perfect in every way? You never had to touch another line of code because you managed to get everything just right the first time around?

Yeah, me neither.

Being a successful app developer usually means making frequent changes to your app. Sometimes, these changes are new features or bug fixes. But, sometimes, the most impactful updates are one-line changes to your code, like adjusting a line of text or nerfing a powerful unit in a tower defense game.

While these kinds of changes are easy to make, publishing them is still a multi-day process. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could make some of these tweaks without having to go through that whole process?

Firebase Remote Config gives you that power. Throughout the course of this Firebase Remote Config tutorial for iOS, you’ll use the Planet Tour sample app to learn how you can change text, colors and other behavior without having to publish new builds! Once mastered, you’ll cover the more powerful feature of delivering different sets of content to different users.
